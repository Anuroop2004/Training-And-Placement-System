# Training-And-Placement-System
The Training and Placement System project is a dynamic platform designed to streamline the process of training and placement for students in educational institutions. Through this system, students have access to a wide range of resources and opportunities aimed at enhancing their employability skills and connecting them with internship and
job placement opportunities. Central to the project is the focus on developing essential employability skills such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork through training modules, workshops, and resources.
